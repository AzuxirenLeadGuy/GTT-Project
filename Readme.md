## Project title: Demo of 5 graph theory topics in an offline OpenGL app

## Application summary

This project will be provide visual demonstration of 5 graph theory algorithms. A user can use to create a user defined simple/directed graph and see the visualized workings of the following algorithms on their custom graph:

- [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search): Provide a pass-by-pass view of Depth first search in a graph.
- [Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search): Provide a pass-by-pass view of Breadth first search in a graph.
- [Dijkstra Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm): Provide a pass-by-pass view of Dijkstra search (also known as the single-source shortest path search) in a graph.
- [Floyd-Warshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm): Provide a pass-by-pass view of All-Pairs shortest path search (using Floyd-warshall algorithn) in a graph.
- [Kruskal's MST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm): Provude a pass-by-pass view of finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal's algorithm.

## Development details:

This project will be using OpenGL bindings provided by the [Monogame framework](https://monogame.net). Monogame is a game engine/framework for creating simple games in C#. These games can be ported to all platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux.
