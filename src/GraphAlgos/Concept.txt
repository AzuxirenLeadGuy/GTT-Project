GraphAlgos will cover pass-by-pass configuration of these 5 algorithms
1. DFS: <SearchFor: Vertex>(May or may not be present in the graph), <Pred: Vertex[]>, <Visited[]: byte/state>
2. BFS: Same as DFS
3. Dijkstra Algorithm: <SearchFor: Vertex>(May or may not be present in the graph), <Pred: Vertex[]>, <Visited[]: byte/state>, <PathHeap: Heap<(Vertex:byte, Distance:int)>>
